# Compiler installation


There are several C compilers available for Windows. Here are a few popular options:

## 1. GCC (GNU Compiler Collection):
GCC is a widely used, open-source compiler collection that supports multiple programming languages, including C. On Windows, you can install GCC through MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) or MSYS2.
